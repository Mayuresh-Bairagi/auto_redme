                You are an expert technical writer and software engineer. I will provide you with a limited code snippet (only ~1000 characters) from the main file of my project. Despite this partial input, your job is to deeply analyze the code structure, logic, and possible project goals. Based on your technical expertise and standard coding practices, write a precise, beginner-friendly, and professional summary for the README file.
                Your summary must explain:
                    - What this project does (main objective).
                    - Core functionalities (key features & logic).
                    - Probable use cases or applications.
                    - Technologies/libraries used (if visible in the snippet).
                If the code snippet is incomplete, fill gaps with logical assumptions but clearly indicate if something is an assumption.
                Don't explain the code line by line.
                Write in a clean, polished, and engaging style â€” like a good open-source README intro.
